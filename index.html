        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am a graduate computer science student doing a masterâ€™s degree in Clemson University. My specialization for the degree is visual computing. I graduated from Temple University on May 2022 with a Bachelor's of science degree in computer science along with a physics minor.  </p>
        <p>I am interested in computer graphics and its applications to physical simulations, rendering photorealistic images and animation. 
            Along with computer graphics, I also have huge interest in physics and in my undergraduate studies 
            I decided to register for a minor in physics and graduated with it finished. Feel free to contact me on ksalem@clemson.edu or on my linkedin <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Note: This website is new and I am still adding stuff to it soon including links to my projects and relevant positions I had in the past. </p>

        <h2>Projects and research:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size: 19px;"> I wrote a numircal solver for time evolution operator of schrodinger equation in 1D. This program allows for 
                    full control over the potential function and intial conditions of the wave function such as the width of gaussian packet or speed.
                    Check out the repo <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kimo-s/One-Dimensional-Schrodinger-Equation-Numerical-Solver">here</a>.
                    Here is an example of the quadratic potential function:

                    </video>
                </li>
                <li style="font-size: 19px;"> Developed a full volumatric ray marching renderer <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kimo-s/RayMarcher">here</a>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>sparse and frustrum shaped grids,</li>
                        <li>constructive solid geometry of any implicit function,</li>
                        <li>Perlin noise fields,</li>
                        <li>and semi Lagrangian fluid simulation with use defined forcing field.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>
                <li style="font-size: 19px;">
                    I developed an extension for Igor Pro to allow for reading of SXM and DAT files generated from scan tunneling microscope software.
                    You can check the repo  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kimo-s/NSDR">here</a>. This was the result of my undergraduate research position in summer of 2021. 
                </li>
                <li style="font-size: 19px;">
                    I was a part of the HopHacks 2018 with a team of 3. We developed a website that helps view revlent places for major emergencies such as natural disaster and show revelent places near a user's
                    location with details provided about this location such as water, food, medicine, etc. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tvdaredevil/EMS-Dashboard">Link to the repo</a>.
