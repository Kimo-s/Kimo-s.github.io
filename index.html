        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am a graduate computer science student doing a masterâ€™s degree in Clemson University. My specialization for the degree is visual computing. I graduated from Temple University on May 2022 with a Bachelor's of science degree in computer science along with a physics minor.  </p>
        <p>I am interested in computer graphics and its applications to physical simulations, rendering photorealistic images and animation. 
            Along with computer graphics, I also have huge interest in physics and in my undergraduate studies 
            I decided to register for a minor in physics and graduated with it finished. Feel free to contact me on ksalem@clemson.edu or on my linkedin <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Note: This website is new and I am still adding stuff to it soon including links to my projects and relevant positions I had in the past. </p>
